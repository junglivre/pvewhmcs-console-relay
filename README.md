# pvewhmcs-console-relay

Console Relay for [Proxmox VE for WHMCS](https://github.com/junglivre/Proxmox-VE-for-WHMCS).

Bridges a browser's noVNC WebSocket to Proxmox's `vncwebsocket` API endpoint,
so Proxmox never needs a public IP, a PTR record, or to share a registrable
domain with WHMCS for cookie purposes. Only this relay needs network
reachability to Proxmox on port 8006 — the same reachability the WHMCS
module already needs for provisioning.

This relay is deployed alongside the WHMCS module; see that project's
[README "noVNC" section](https://github.com/junglivre/Proxmox-VE-for-WHMCS#-2-novnc-console-tunnel-client-area)
for the WHMCS-side setup (restricted `vnc@pve` user, Module Config fields).

## Run this standalone — it's a long-lived WebSocket server

Don't deploy this behind a generic app-server/PaaS-style process manager.
Those are built around short request/response cycles and often reverse-bind
or proxy the port your app listens on, which breaks a raw `http.Server` +
`ws` process holding many long-lived duplex WebSocket connections open for
the duration of each console session. Run it
as its own process (systemd below) and reverse-proxy to it directly with a
web server that has first-class WebSocket support (nginx, or Apache with
`mod_proxy_wstunnel`).

## How it fits together

Two supported layouts, both fronting a single standalone `node server.js`
process:

```text
Same domain:  Browser --wss--> WHMCS domain (443) --reverse proxy /pve-console-ws/--> relay (127.0.0.1:8765) --wss--> Proxmox:8006 (private)
Subdomain:    Browser --wss--> vnc.example.com (443) -----------reverse proxy /---------> relay (127.0.0.1:8765) --wss--> Proxmox:8006 (private)
```

`pvewhmcs_noVNC()` (in the WHMCS module) mints a short-lived, HMAC-signed,
single-use token describing the Proxmox target (host, path, the restricted
`vnc@pve` PVEAuthCookie). The browser only ever sees that opaque token. This
relay verifies it, opens the real connection to Proxmox, and pipes bytes
both ways.

If you deploy the relay on its own subdomain, set that subdomain in WHMCS
under **Addons > Proxmox VE for WHMCS > Config > Console Relay Host** (and
**Console Relay Port** only if it isn't the default `443`). Leave both blank
to keep sharing the WHMCS domain instead.

## 1. Deploy the relay

```bash
git clone https://github.com/junglivre/pvewhmcs-console-relay.git /opt/pvewhmcs-console-relay
cd /opt/pvewhmcs-console-relay
cp config.example.json config.json
# edit config.json: set "secret" to the same value as WHMCS's Module Config
# "Console Relay Secret" (generate one with: openssl rand -hex 32)
npm install --omit=dev
```

Create `/etc/systemd/system/pvewhmcs-console-relay.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Proxmox VE for WHMCS - Console Relay
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt/pvewhmcs-console-relay
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node server.js
Restart=on-failure
User=<a dedicated non-root system user>

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now pvewhmcs-console-relay
```

Confirm it's alive locally before wiring up the reverse proxy:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/healthz
# ok
```

## 2. Reverse-proxy it

The relay only listens on `127.0.0.1`; it is never exposed directly.
Whatever serves the public domain/subdomain must reverse-proxy to it,
passing the WebSocket `Upgrade` header through untouched.

**Dedicated subdomain** (proxy the whole thing):

Nginx:

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8765;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
}
```

Apache (needs `mod_proxy_wstunnel` and `mod_rewrite` enabled):

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} =websocket [NC]
RewriteRule ^/(.*)   ws://127.0.0.1:8765/$1   [P,L]
ProxyPass        / http://127.0.0.1:8765/
ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

**Sharing the WHMCS domain instead** (proxy only the one path prefix):

```nginx
location /pve-console-ws/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8765;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_read_timeout 3600s;
}
```

Adjust the port in any of the above to match `listenPort` in `config.json`.

## 3. Verify

1. In WHMCS Client Area, request a console for an active VM/CT.
2. Click "Launch noVNC". The browser should connect to
   `wss://<console-relay-host>/pve-console-ws/<token>` — where
   `<console-relay-host>` is either your dedicated subdomain (Console Relay
   Host in Module Config) or the WHMCS domain if you left that blank. Check
   DevTools' Network tab; it must **not** be a direct connection to the
   Proxmox host, and the upgrade response should be `101 Switching
   Protocols`, not a stall.
3. If it fails immediately with code `4401`, the token was invalid/expired —
   check the relay's log (`journalctl -u pvewhmcs-console-relay`) and
   confirm both secrets match exactly.
4. If the WebSocket never reaches `open`, the reverse proxy likely isn't
   passing the `Upgrade` header through — re-check Section 2.

## Security notes

- Rotate `secret` by updating it in both places (WHMCS Module Config and
  `config.json`) — old, in-flight tokens simply stop validating.
- The relay never touches the WHMCS database or PVE credentials beyond what
  each token carries; a leaked relay log line still requires the signed
  token to reconnect, and tokens expire in under a minute.
- Keep `listenPort` bound to `127.0.0.1` (already the default) so it is only
  reachable through the reverse proxy, never directly from the Internet.
